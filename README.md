# Thanks for checking my solution to the frontend mentor challenge.


# It is a mobile-first solution.
# Used CSS3 concepts such as flexbox, grid and background sizing.
# I mainly used HTML and CSS for the project with a bit of JavaScript for the menu icon, hover effect and adding contents dynamically.

# It was a very good challenge, learnt new concepts such as: object-fit(for making an image or an element fit into a container), dynamically import a CSS file based on the size of the width screen, the use of CSS grid and flexbox in one element(yeah you can do that!) etc.

# The project was quite challenging barring the desktop view that needs a bit of work with the image background positioning(95% done though).
# Looking foward to the next challenge.
